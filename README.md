### Professor Comment: 
Thank you for your efforts and submission. Your assignment on analysing the relationship between education and economic output demonstrates a very good understanding of the key concepts and methodologies required for this analysis.  

 

Data Collection: You used the World Bank's WDI database and selected appropriate indicators for your analysis. The selected data period is consistent and comparable across countries. Nevertheless, providing further details on the specific steps taken to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data would have enhanced the comprehensiveness of this section.   

 

Data Preparation: Your data cleaning process is thorough, and you structured the data appropriately prior to performing the analysis. Well done on normalising the variables to ensure a consistent scale amongst them. Nevertheless, a more detailed description of the normalisation process and any challenges faced during data preparation would have enhanced the comprehensiveness of this section.  

 

Exploratory Data Analysis: You computed the required descriptive statistics and created scatter plots to visualise the relationships between variables. Your description of the observed patterns is appropriate and relevant. To enhance the comprehensiveness of this section, you could have provided a more detailed analysis of the scatter plots and discussed any outliers or anomalies in the data.  

 

Simple Linear Regression Analysis: Your regression analysis is appropriate and relevant, with clear reporting of the regression equations, interpretation of the slope and intercept, and computation of the R-squared values. The residual analysis was also performed appropriately. Nevertheless, discussing the implications of the R-squared values in further detail and the rationale for these results would have enhanced the comprehensiveness of this section.  

 

Interpretation and Discussion: You provided an appropriate and relevant interpretation of the results, discussing the strength and direction of the relationships identified. The limitations and potential confounding factors were identified and discussed, and your policy implications are appropriate and relevant. To enhance the comprehensiveness of this section, you could have further discussed the trade-offs and decisions made during the analysis and provided further specific examples of how the findings could inform the delineation or enhancement of policies.  

 

Regarding your references, in future assignments, please provide a range of peer-reviewed journals and conference papers to support your analysis. Not listing any peer-reviewed sources, except for citing the use of ChatGPT, hinders the academic rigour of your work.
